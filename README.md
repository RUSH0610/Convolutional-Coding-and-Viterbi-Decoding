# Convolutional Coding and Viterbi Decoding

**Duration**: February 2024 â€“ March 2024  
**Guide**: Prof. Yash Vasavda

## Project Overview

This project implements Convolutional Encoding and Viterbi Decoding techniques used for error correction in digital communication systems. The system simulates message transmission over a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) and evaluates the performance of both Hard-Decision and Soft-Decision Viterbi decoders.

## Features

- Convolutional encoder supporting variable constraint lengths and generator polynomials
- Hard-decision Viterbi decoder
- Soft-decision Viterbi decoder
- Simulation over Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)
- Bit Error Rate (BER) performance analysis and comparison
- MATLAB-based plotting and visualization of results

## Key Concepts

- Trellis diagram traversal
- Traceback decoding
- Hard and soft decision metrics (Hamming and Euclidean distances)
- Graph-based pathfinding for optimal decoding
- Noise simulation over Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)

## Output

- BER vs. SNR plots for hard and soft decision decoding
- Performance comparison across different code rates
- Evaluation of theoretical vs. practical decoding results
